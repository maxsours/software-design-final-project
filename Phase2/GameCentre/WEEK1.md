# WEEK 1 notes
Below are listed what decisions were made in our week 1 meeting. If a task must be completed
before another task is completed, this is specified below.
​In our lab and lecture of this week, we compartmentalized the client's request for Phase 1 
​into a list of tasks:
​	
- **Max Thomas Sours** was given the responsibility to implement a **Game Launch Centre**. His 
        Game Launch Centre should be on the users screen when the app is initialized. Max should 
        code the Game Launch Centre to provide the option for users to sign up with username and 
        password, it should offer the ability to start a new game, load previous saved games, and 
        be flexible enough to accommodate extra features that may be added later. This task is to be
        finished first, as most other tasks are contingent on its implementation.

- **Luka Trkla** was given the responsibility to implement the **Puzzle Game Complexity** 
        feature. By default, when the user has not specified what complexity they wish to play 
        with, the initialized board should be by default 4*4. This feature is to be implemented 
        after Game Launch Centre is available.

- **Bryan Steven Elcorrobarrutia** was given the responsibility to implement the **undo** feature. 
        When a puzzle game is initialized, the user will have the option to revert three of their 
        previous moves, and no more. If time permits, the user should have the option to select how 
        many undos they wish to play with from a selection of possible numbers of undos; by default 
        the number of undos should be 3. This feature is to be implemented after Game Launch Centre 
        has been made available.

- **Jia Nian Chiah** was given the responsibility to implement the **Autosave and Scoreboard** 
        feature. We agreed that when the current game has been played a number of moves that is 
        congruent 0 modulo 3, the game should be saved (every 3 moves the game is saved.) We agreed 
        this feature was to be implemented after Game Launch Centre was available. The scoreboard 
        should bw available on Game Launch Centre and should provide the option to show per-game and 
        per-user scoreboards. How the group interpreted this task was made available to the reader 
        in our README.md file. As this feature uses methods and variables that would be implemented
        in making the Autosave feature, the scoreboard should be finalized soon after implementing 
        the Autosave feature.

- **Hunain Bin Aleem** was given the responsibility to attempt to both design software that would
        splice a user's given image and store these images, to allow for the app to play with both 
        Number Tiles and an image.
