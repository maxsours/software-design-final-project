This Is not our README HELPER, but was placed here to help the reader to find our README.md, and
TEAM.md files, if they haven't been found yet. When we created our project with Paul Gries' help, 
we made the Gradle Project to be: StudioProjects\group_0513\Phase1\GameCentre, which prevented us
from saving the README.md and TEAM.md files in Phase1 directly. These Files Can be found in
StudioProjects\group_0513\Phase1\GameCentre.
