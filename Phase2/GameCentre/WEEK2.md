# Week 2
In our spare time, we met as a group in Robarts Stacks to discuss in detail how we were to
implement our features in such a way as to make our code flexible to newly implemented features.
 Although many of the responsibilities were primarily assigned for one person to implement, 
 it should be noted that we often worked as a unit to implement the feature optimally. 
 With this in mind, below are all the decisions made in that meeting, who is responsible for 
 implementing these decisions, and the order of the tasks to be completed.

 - **Luka Trkla** decided that he would generate new picture tiles to allow for the app to be 
        played with a picture. This was decided to be completed as soon as possible after the meeting 
        concluded. He also decided to change the User interface by adding a popup when New Game is 
        pressed, to make the Game Launch centre less crowded. This was decided to be completed as soon 
        as our meeting ended.

- **Jia Nian Chiah** decided to implement the ability for the scoreboard to automatically 
        update when a game is won, preventing the user from cheating by inputting a value directly into the 
        scoreboard. This was decided to be implemented after the meeting concluded.

- **Bryan Steven Elcorrobarrutia** decided to add the option for the user to change the
        number of undos they wish to play with before initializing a new game. Bryan talked over 
        and confirmed the logistics of implementing an undo and the possible errors that could
        happen. After this discussion, he decided to make the undo button undo one move of the 
        allotted number of undos at a time and not all n at once. This was to be done after Bryan 
        resolved any possible errors from implementing the undo feature.

- **Hunain Bin Aleem** After Luka generated new picture tiles, Hunain would implement the ability 
        to make the game playable with both an image, and with number tiles. We faced difficulties 
        with configuring the app to accept the User's images. For your consideration, we've placed 
        Hunain's work as a BitmapSpliceSaveJava.txt file in the Game Centre Folder. An explanation 
        for why the code was not useful can be found within that file.

 - **Max Thomas Sours** decided to invest his time in debugging issues with the login/logout 
        prompt, and issues with User's data being generated properly. This was to be resolved 
        as soon as possible.

All members of the team contributed to the README.md, TEAM.txt, and to the User Interface of the app.
