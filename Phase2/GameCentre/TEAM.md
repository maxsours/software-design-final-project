## COMMUNICATION TOOLS UTILIZED:
We created a discord server, where all group members joined. Here we
​	spoke to one another about issues pertaining to this project. All 
​	members checked and responded in this server frequently.
​	
## TEAM CONTRACT:
As a team, we vow that we will execute the following to the best of our ability:
​		Each member will finish their allotted work on time. 
​		They will attend every meeting, whether it be a lab or a meeting organized by the group.
​		When in a group meeting each member will actively participate in said meeting.
​		In the event that an emergency arises that prevents a group member from 
​		attending a team meeting, they will notify the group immediately.
​		The work was divided into roughly equal parts among our 5 team members. 
​		How we chose to partition this work is evident in our WEEK1.md file, which was saved 
​		in the folder where this file was saved. Each team member will help the team to 
​		understand every concept in the project. 
​		If any aspect of the code, or a concept in coding is unclear to any member, each 
​		member vows that they will immediately ask the group for help.
​		Everyone will contribute code to the assignment.
​		

## DISCUSSION ON WHETHER TO WORK INDIVIDUALLY OR IN PAIRS:
In our first meeting, we agreed that it would be too difficult for us to work in pairs,
​	as we all had midterms, and often our schedules conflicted. We decided to work individually, 
​	with the understanding that our Discord server is an invaluable resource to use for 
​	near-immediate response, in case someone needed assistance in the group.

## NOTES ON MEETINGS:
We were told by our TA that we were to produce notes on our weekly meetings, and to
​	save these notes as markdown files. These files are available in the same folder this
​	file was saved in. There are two Files WEEK1.md for our week 1 meeting, and 
​	WEEK2.md, for our week 2 meeting.
